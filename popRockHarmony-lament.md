**&#124;&#124;: I – VII – VI – V :&#124;&#124;**

This progression need not be included in a cycle, but occasionally it does. It is named the “lament” progression because in early classical music, this chord progression (almost always in minor) was used as the *ground bass* (a repeated bass pattern that formed be foundation for a set of variations, not unlike the cyclical progressions of pop/rock songs) for songs of lament. Examples include “Dido’s Lament” by Henry Purcell, from the opera *Dido and Aeneas*, and J.S. Bach’s “Crucifixus,” from his Mass in B Minor.

The opening of the verse in Muse’s “Thoughts of a Dying Atheist” is a prominent example from recent pop/rock music (there it is followed by a circle-of-fifths progression; see below).
